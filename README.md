Project Description: build a Restful API that returns records in a dataframe in JSON format based on input parameters
Input: a dataframe generated by main.py as shown below.
  id          level          text
0  1        [a, ab]   hello world
1  2  [a, b, c, cd]  good morning
2  3  [a, b, c, cd]      new york
3  4            [a]   programming
4  5         [x, y]      computer


The program will take http GET request and generate JSON outputs: 

Request: http://localhost:5000/query?level=a
Output: JSON format of records 1,2,3, and 4 since they have 'a' in the list level.

Request: http://localhost:5000/query?level=a&level=b
Output: JSON format of records 1, 2,3 and 4  since they have 'a' or  'b' in the list level.

Request: http://localhost:5000/query?level=x
Output: JSON format of record 5 since it has 'x' in the list level.

Request: http://localhost:5000/query?level=z
